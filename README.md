Sometimes it becomes really hard to find a specific vaccination from close by vaccination centers because it is either sold out or not available. During this situation people tend to search for online. This process becomes time consuming and costly as in online vaccination stores, they have certain warehouses where the vaccinations are placed, and the shipping is done from that place.  In the previous couple of decades, technology has made a profound impact on the lives of people. Technology has influenced human practices to a considerably more prominent degree. Some people continue discovering approaches to do their work in a convenient way. They are becoming lazy and seek ease in every aspect of life. People are constantly looking for new services that would enable them to do their work efficiently in order to save their time. SSo, in order to address these problems, we have developed an android-based system named as SANTE. This system helps in finding required vaccinations and can order. In this system, user can register and enters his information and can order required vaccination the vaccination will be provided to them on their door step.
